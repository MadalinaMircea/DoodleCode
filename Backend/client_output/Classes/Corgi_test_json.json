		"description": The Welsh Corgi ( plural "Corgis" or occasionally the etymologically consistent "Corgwn"; ) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. Sometimes just known as a Corgi, two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. There are physical differences between the two. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used.
The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained in popularity because the Queen has personally owned more than 30 Pembrokes or Corgi-Dachshund crosses, known as dorgis. Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two. The Pembroke is the more popular breed of the two, but still appears on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable dog breeds of the United Kingdom.
